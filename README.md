## Description

The primary purpose of this project is to create an application that takes two numbers and shows all increments of the lower number up to the higher number's limit.  Examples and specs listed below.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Install Git Bash for Git repository cloning of the project
* Install Atom for review and edit of Code
* To access repository for project and review code, first clone repository at the appropriate link, then use Git Bash and/or Atom to open the project folder.
* GitHub Repository link is https://github.com/RJGore92/increment-counter.

## Known Bugs

No known bugs are present in this project.

## Assignment Specs

1. The program takes two input numbers on a form and determines which is the larger of the two numbers.
2. Upon looking at the two numbers and figuring out which is the larger, it assigns that number as the upper limit and the other as the incrementing number.
3. The project then takes the two numbers and assigns them locations in a for loop, using the smaller number as the initial value and incrementing value while the larger number takes the upper limit within the loop.
4. During each increment in the for loop, the value of i is printed to a list and incremented by the incrementing number, up to but not beyond the upper limit.  The total increments based on the two inputs is displayed in a list below the form.

## Inputs and expected outputs:

* Program will execute the specs above if any number is zero or negative, nor if any field is left blank.

* Input A: 5, Input B: 2, output list results: 2, 4.
* Input A: 13, Input B: 100, output list results: 13, 26, 39, 52, 65, 78, 91.
* Input A: 180, Input B: 31, output list results: 31, 62, 93, 124, 155.
